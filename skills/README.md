# Chimera Agent Skills

## Overview
Skills are modular, reusable capability packages used by Chimera agents
at runtime.

Each skill:
- Has a single responsibility
- Defines clear input/output contracts
- Can be independently tested and evolved

Skills are invoked by agents via MCP-compatible interfaces.
