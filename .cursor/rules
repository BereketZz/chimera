# Project Chimera — AI Agent Rules

## Project Context
This is **Project Chimera**, an autonomous influencer system.
Chimera consists of multiple AI agents operating in a coordinated swarm to:
- Fetch trends and signals from the web
- Generate and evaluate content
- Publish to social platforms via MCP tools
- Track memory, performance, and economic activity

All development decisions must align with this vision.

---

## Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without first checking the `specs/` directory.**

If specifications are missing, incomplete, or unclear:
- STOP
- Explain what is missing
- Propose updates to the specs before writing any code

---

## Traceability Requirement
Before writing any code or configuration:
1. Explain your understanding of the task
2. Outline a clear plan of action
3. Reference relevant files in `specs/`

Only proceed to code after the plan is approved.

---

## Behavioral Constraints
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Do not invent APIs, schemas, or agent behavior not defined in specs
- Assume this is a production-grade system, not a prototype
- When uncertain, ask for clarification instead of guessing

---

## Architectural Bias
- Favor Planner–Worker–Judge or Orchestrator–Agent patterns
- Assume MCP tools are the primary interface to external systems
- Design for scalability, observability, and human-in-the-loop control
